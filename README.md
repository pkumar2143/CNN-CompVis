# CNN-CompVis
This repository houses a project for a course in Mathematical Techniques for Data Science taken in Spring 2020. <br> <br>

Project abstract: The goal of this project is two-fold.  The first goal is to explore the field of computer vision fromits  history  to  the  usefulness  of  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs).   The  second  goal  is  tostudy the design of CNN architectures and to implement these ideas for the purpose of detectingthe most common type of breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We use image datafrom “Deep Learning for Digital Pathology Image Analysis:  A Comprehensive Tutorial WithSelected Use Cases”, a survey on digital pathology techniques conducted by Andrew Janowczykand Anant Madabhushi in 2016.  For this second goal, we start with a simple densely connectedneural network for a baseline comparison. Much of the work of this project went into the design ofProNet, a CNN architecture made scratch using common design principles.  Finally, we explore ascaled version of AlexNet implemented by Janowczyk and Madabhushi.  The hope of this projectis to inspire readers to pursue further study in the field on computer vision and deep learning.
